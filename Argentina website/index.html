                                Lionel Messi, (born June 24, 1987, Rosario, Arg.), Argentine-born football (soccer) player. After making his formal debut with FC Barcelona during the 2004–05 season, when he became the youngest official player and goal scorer in the Spanish La Liga, he emerged as one of the game’s dominant players, known for his prolific goal scoring and precise ball control. Messi received an unprecedented four consecutive FIFA world men’s player of the year awards, from 2009 to 2012, and he won the award again in 2015 and 2019. In international competition he helped Argentina win a gold medal at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. He also led the Argentine national team to win the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 World Cup.
